## Overview
This repository holds the code for my BIT CPT final project for the spring 2023 semester. The analysis is organized into a [makefile](https://github.com/jhgille2/bit_cpt_2023/blob/main/makefile) that can be run on the hpc with a [job script](https://github.com/jhgille2/bit_cpt_2023/blob/main/job.sh). The pipeline can't be run completely "out of the box", but I've tried to make it as painless as possible to work with our data and directory structure for the class.
